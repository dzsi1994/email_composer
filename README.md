# Ebury

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.0.

## Project Set up
First clone the repository and then go to the folder called email_composer and run npm i.
If you do not have installed node.js on your device please installed it from here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Please make sure you dowload and install the same as your OS.
If you want to run the application you need to have angular-cli installed. 
Please run: npm install -g @angular/cli
## How to run development server

Run `ng s` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. 

I personally recommend running `ng s -o` and the application will automatically open in the default browser.
